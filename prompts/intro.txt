You find before yourself a programming puzzle:

${part1_text}
${part2_text}

Please solve the problem by writing pure lean code, you can
structure your inputs as follows:

```lean4
import Input

def part1 (input : String) -> String := ...

def part2 (input : String) -> String :=

def main : IO Unit := do
  IO.println part1 Input.string
  IO.println part2 Input.string
```

make sure to only include the exact string of the solution.

Good luck, have fun!
